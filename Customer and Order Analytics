#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data.

-- Question #1
-- How many many unique orders were placed in January? In other words, how many distinct order ids do we have?
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT orderID)
FROM JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6 AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
;

-- Question #2
-- How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT orderID)
FROM JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6 AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
AND Product = 'iPhone'
;    

-- Question #3
-- Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT c.acctnum
FROM customers c
JOIN ( SELECT DISTINCT orderID
        FROM FebSales
        WHERE length(orderID) = 6 AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
    ) feb
ON c.order_id = feb.orderID
;

-- Question #4
-- Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT DISTINCT product
,price
FROM JanSales
ORDER BY price
LIMIT 1
;

-- Question #5
-- What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT product
,ROUND(SUM(quantity) * price, 2) total_revenue
FROM JanSales
GROUP BY product
;

-- Question #6
-- Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT product
,quantity
,SUM(quantity) * price revenvue
FROM FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product
;

-- Question #7
-- How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT COUNT(c.acctnum) customers
,AVG(fs.quantity * fs.price) average_spent
FROM customers c
JOIN FebSales fs ON c.order_id = fs.orderID
WHERE fs.quantity > 2 AND length(c.order_id) = 6 AND c.order_id <> 'Order ID'
;
