#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data.

-- Question #1
-- How many many unique orders were placed in January? In other words, how many distinct order ids do we have?
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT orderID)
FROM JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6 AND orderID <> 'Order ID'

-- Question #2
-- How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT orderID)
FROM JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6 AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
AND Product = 'iPhone'

-- Question #3
-- Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT c.acctnum
FROM customers c
JOIN ( SELECT DISTINCT orderID
        FROM FebSales

;

-- Question #4
-- Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT DISTINCT product
,price
FROM JanSales
ORDER BY price
LIMIT 1

-- Question #5
-- What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT product

-- Question #6
-- Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT product

FROM FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product
;

-- Question #7
-- How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT COUNT(c.acctnum) customers
,AVG(fs.quantity * fs.price) average_spent

-- List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.
SELECT product

-- 4. What was the average quantity of products purchased per account in February?
SELECT SUM(fs.quantity)/COUNT(acctnum) avg_quantity
FROM customers c

-- 5. Which product brought in the most revenue in January and how much revenue did it bring in total?
SELECT product
